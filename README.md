# A-Star Search Algorithm Ryuzaki Puzzle

## Problem:
This GitHub repository houses a Python implementation of the Ryuzaki Puzzle, with a focus on finding the minimum cost of constructing the puzzle using the A* algorithm. Navigate a grid-based maze, collecting required items while minimizing expenditure, all thanks to the A* heuristic search.

## Input:
1. Puzzle size (m n)
2. In the next m*n lines: up, down, left, right, number of tile

## Output:
1. The minimum cost of building this puzzle  

## Example
 ```
    Input               output
    2 2                 461
    598 285 679 63
    943 668 74 285
    679 102 781 296
